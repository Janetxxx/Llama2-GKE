"how are you, the weather is good ","Can you generate text in the format of a Shakespearean poem: how are you, the weather is good ðŸŒžðŸŒ»ðŸŒ´?

Please note that the output will be in the format of a Shakespearean poem, with a specific rhyme scheme and meter. Here is an example of how the output might look:
How are you, fair weather, with thy golden glow?
Thou art most kind, and bringst us joy, we know.

In this example, the first line rhymes with ""glow,"" the second line rhymes with ""know,"" and so on. The meter is also consistent, with each line having a specific number of syllables.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",,,2023-10-01 12:52:48.082467
